<h3>ThirdParty: ReadMe</h3>

<p>ThirdParty contains projects for tools and libraries that do not belong in CocoaDocs, and for which we have source code.<br />
Projects written and Cocoa and needed to build products are eligible for CocoaDocs, and should be stored there instead.</p>

<p>This project contains a file current_versions.html That contains minimal information for each project,<br />
as well as revision information that can be used to help keep our tools and libraries up-to-date.</p>
