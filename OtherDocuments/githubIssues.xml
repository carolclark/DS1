    "body": "When direct Punkin development was interrupted in early January, 2013 by Mountain Lion Upgrade, need for collaborator support and switch to github, we were in the middle of refactoring Error handling and testing (using OCUnit) for Words. That code relied on method WordsApp.+(int)didFailWithError:(NSError *)error operation:(NSString *)operation, which customizes the error as indicated and presents it to the user. It probably came from Core Data sample and/or tutorial code. We now understand that Core Data error handling does not follow normal patterns.\n\n### Issues\n\n##### Standard Error Handling\n* Use more standard structure where methods return `NSError`'s that can be tested for, and that provides for Recovery Attempters. See [RMErrorRecoveryAttempter](https://github.com/realmacsoftware/RMErrorRecoveryAttempter)\n\n##### Core Data Error Handling\n* apparently, the philosophy is that Core Data errors are almost all programmer errors (possibly could be handled with Exceptions?)\n* apparently, errors are much more of a problem with an iCloud store\n* maybe `didFailWithError` is reasonable as at least part of the solution in Core Data code\n* *see also [iPhone Core Data “Production” Error Handling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2262704/iphone-core-data-production-error-handling)*\n\n##### OCUnit vs GHUnit\n* In pursuing these issues, we again encountered the issue of OCUnit vs GHUnit\n    * *If we switch, tests could still be written in OCUnit; target would be reconstructed to use GHUnit*\n    * OCUnit has distinction between application and logic tests; GHUnit does not\n        * *that distinction serves no apparent purpose*\n    * GHUnit has setup/teardown methods for class; OCUnit does not\n        * *especially significant if large amount of data or resources to be set up*\n    * GHUnit runs an any device or simulator; OCUnit has restrictions\n        * *the OCUnit restrictions for iOS development have looked before like a serious problem*\n    * GHUnit presents results in UITableView, OCUnit in build log\n        * *GHUnit much better*\n    * GHUnit separates unit testing from build process\n        * *we normally restructure OCUnit tests in Xcode to separate them, canceling out the simple setup that is supposed to be OCUnit's biggest advantage*\n    * GHUnit allows running individual tests or failed tests\n        * *may make it possible to have some slow tests that are run less often, maybe daily* \n    * Xcode can reuse build to run OCUnit tests, which may make build/test a little faster\n    * Apple's support for unit testing appears intermittent and unreliable (based on personal observation and internet buzz; see also [Back to GHUnit](http://iosunittesting.com/back-to-ghunit)\n\n##### OCMock\n* In order to test, we were attempting to use a home-grown mock Alert object. Something based on OCMock would probably be more practical.\n\n### Conclusions\n* switch to GHUnit targets for testing (test files do not need to be changed unless GHUnit features are needed)\n* move didFailWithError to Core Data code\n* in other code, use more standard structure where methods return `NSError`'s that can be tested for, and that provides for Recovery Attempters. See [RMErrorRecoveryAttempter](https://github.com/realmacsoftware/RMErrorRecoveryAttempter)\n* use OCMock when mock objects are needed for testing, probably at least for Core Data testing\n\nLinks: [Unit Testing in Xcode 4 Quick Start Guide](http://www.raywenderlich.com/3716/unit-testing-in-xcode-4-quick-start-guide); [iPhone Core Data “Production” Error Handling](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2262704/iphone-core-data-production-error-handling); [GHUnit](http://gabriel.github.io/gh-unit/docs/index.html); [Back to GHUnit](http://iosunittesting.com/back-to-ghunit)"
