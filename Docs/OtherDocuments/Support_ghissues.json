Now:\n    - AppCode: We have not figured out how to define environment variables and have them available to scripts; defining with configuration seems to disappear frequently, and the variables are not available anyway (logging $CCDev value yields empty string).\n    - TeamCity: We would like to have CCDev contents available as build artifacts. The default location for build artifacts is inside the checkout directory, e.g. Support. We do not know how to change that default location (may require updating to external database), and that location would be inappropriate for the other environments.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nVariables affected:\n- $DEV\n    - location of all projects and sources \n    - use relative locations instead when possible - ccInstall also has function DEV to calculate that value\n- $CCDev\n    - destination for most build output\n    - probably should be injected to build scripts as a parameter\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nParameters:\n    - existing:\n        - &lt;\"${SRCROOT}\"&gt; - available as $(pwd)?\n        - &lt; ${TARGET_NAME}&gt; - should be supplied by script\n        - &lt; $(ACTION)&gt;\n    - new:\n        - &lt; $CCDev&gt;\n        - &lt; $(ACTION)&gt;\n\n##### **Refactor Developer_install.ksh to Developer_build.sh** #####\nimprovements expected: change to bash; rename `install` to `copy_file` (Developer only); incorporate execInstallScript; change parameters, injecting $CCDev; $action: clean (project) | build | test | install\n<br />\ncontinue support for callbacks"
