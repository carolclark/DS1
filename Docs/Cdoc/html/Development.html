<!-- @marker "Legacy Status Notes" -->
<h4><a id="ArchiveStatus">Deprecated and Legacy: Status Notes</a></h4><ul>
	<li>Accessor_C9<ul>
		<li>our current speech recognition application</li>
		<li>started as a port from a CodeWarrior project; now in Carbon</li>
		<li>to be replaced with a new Cocoa project and extensively refactored</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Support_svn<ul>
		<li>predecessor to current project Support; features are currently being moved into project Support</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>DevSupport<ul>
		<li>older predecessor to current project Support; features are currently being moved into project Support</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>WebGen<ul>
		<li class='blurb'>This project was an attempt to capture techniques used by iWeb for use in a more structured way. It did not work, and now MobileMe, which provided support for some of the interesting features of iWeb sites, is no longer available.</li>
		<li>Update our iWeb site to directly produce our Family subsite.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Koala Framework<ul>
		<li class='blurb'>These projects were developed to get started with building and testing Frameworks.</li>
		<li class='blurb'>However, iOS requires self-contained apps, and therefore cannot use frameworks.	</li>
		<li>Koala_Try1<ul>
			<li>Framework project that also implements models for testing</li>
			<li>Koala_Try1 builds the framework; does not have a separate build scheme, but is built by target KoalaUnitTests_Try1</li>
			<li>KoalaUnitTests_Try1 builds the Koala framework and runs unit tests against it</li>
			<li>AllTests_Try1 builds and runs tests in a standalone GHUnit application</li>
			<li>Doxygen target builds a Doxygen docset</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Koala_Try2<ul>
			<li>intended as a replacement for Koala_Try1, but only got as far as to work on revising the documentation</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>MyLibrary<ul>
			<li>partial implementation of a target that uses a custom framework</li>
			<li>target MyLibrary: opens a standard window, and displays a log message to the console; uses framework Koala_Try1, but does not successfully #import it "Koala.h" header</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>ArbonneProto<ul>
		<li>attempt at implementing a replacement for the existing FileMaker Arbonne database in Cocoa and Core Data</li>
		<li>demonstrates techniques we were using for Cocoa development</li>
		<li>Core Data code was poorly structured, and probably should not be emulated</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>ArbonneFM<ul>
		<li>documentation for existing FileMaker Arbonne database; useful, at least for its specification of tables and fields, until a replacement has been developed</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
