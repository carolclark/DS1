<h2 class="promote" id="Overview_">Development Overview</h2><ul>
	<li>For most tasks in our development process, we use JetBrains products.<ul>
		<li>IDE's for development languages also available:<ul>
			<li>AppCode (previously in use): primary support for Objective-C++; plugins for unix and AppleScript</li>
			<li>WebStorm (for html and javascript; we are currently using AppCode with sed(!!) instead of javascript; PyCharm with Django</li>
			<li>PHPStorm for Website indices; DataGrip for database storage; MPS for DSL development</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Team Tools for managing workflow and development process:<ul>
			<li>YouTrack: issue tracking; agile development</li>
			<li>TeamCity (previously in use): Continuous Integration</li>
			<li>UpSource: code review</li>
			<li>Hub, aka HubRing, to tie it all together</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Agile_">Agile Development</h3>
	<p>Our process is very similar to standard test-first agile development,
	but with a different approach toward time management. For our 'sprints',
	which we call 'Gaggles', we use a time estimate, not a deadline.</p>
	<div class="paragraphs">
		<h4>Gaggles</h4><ul>
			<li>target dates are established, but are normally adjusted if and when indicated
				toward the actual time needed</li>
			<li>we expect to learn to make better estimates of time required as we use
				this technique</li>
			<li>if a task has a 'black box' step that we cannot estimate, it is probably not ready for development;
				a separate required-dependency task could be used here to separate the tasks of gathering information and estimating</li>
			<li>YouTrack's 'fix version' fields is intended to identify cards for a scrum.
				We will change 'fix version' to 'gaggle' to identify cards (geese?) for a Gaggle.
				For assigning version numbers, we prefer to <a href="Git.html#Branches_Releases_">establish the version number</a>
				when the product is ready for 'release',
				as recommended by <a href="https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html">GitFlow</a>,
				on which our versioning plan is based.</li>

	<p>The first feature we really need is YouTrack's Agile Boards. However: Hub must be installed first
	so that other tools can be connected to it, and; apparently YouTrack depends on TeamCity and UpSource to provide
	access to each project's GitHub issues.</p>
	<p>Also, except for Team City, the tools are new to us. We will install the basics first,
		and then proceed with other features after we have more familiarity with the tools.</p>

<!-- @marker "Motivation" -->
<h4 id='Motivation_'>Motivation</h4>
	<p>We have been using AppCode instead of Xcode for basic development for a little over two years (since Jan 2015).
		The decision to switch to AppCode was motivated by independent advocates, notably <a href="http://qualitycoding.org/start-here/">Jon Reid</a>;
		their top reason was AppCode's refactoring capability in comparison with Xcode, with many other areas where AppCode was better.</p>
	<p>About one year ago, we adopted JetBrains' TeamCity for continuous integration, and Kanban for planning through waffle.io.</p>
	<p>Each of these steps helped us to improve our workflow considerably.</p>
	<p>However, continuous integration frequently finds bugs for which we have a lot of difficulty finding a connection in the code.
		Most of these problems come from legacy code.
		We need better workflow to work more effectively on planning, implementation, and focus for add tasks, and especially with legacy code.</p>
	<p>JetBrains also have tools for Developer and Manager workflow that integrate with each other, with TeamCity, and with the IDE.
		These include Agile planning boards with many advantages over waffle.io.</p>
	<p>JetBrains is a large company with headquarters in St. Petersburg, Russia, and many other locations across Europe and the US.
		They also have a huge installed base of products, all of which receive many kudos for their quality.
		We do not expect them to disappear.</p>

<!-- @marker "JetBrains Team Tools" -->
<h4 id='JetBrainsTeamTools_'>JetBrains Team Tools</h4>
	<p><strong>YouTrack</strong>: Issue tracker for development teams</p>
		<p class="indent">JetBrains system for integrating issues. Links with GitHub.
			Replaces Waffle Kanban board with Agile boards (no scrums required) that also provide a specialized planning board,
			and provide integration with AppCode and other tools.
			Support a single set of Agile boards for all GitHub projects,
			allowing improved planning and prioritization without requiring combination of repos.</p>

	<p><strong>TeamCity</strong>: Powerful Continuous Integration out of the box</p>
		<p class="indent">Continuous Integration we have been using and are very pleased.</p>

    <p><strong>UpSource</strong>: Code review and repository browsing</p>
		<p class="indent">Code review is normally done among peers, but we use UpSource to review code from our own multiple perspectives.</p>

	<p><strong>Hub</strong>: JetBrains Tools, integrated</p>

<!-- @marker "Toolbox and IDEs" -->
<h4 id='ToolboxandIDEs_'>Toolbox and IDEs</h4>
	<p>JetBrains provides a large variety of IDEs. We have been happily using their AppCode for Objective-C for a year now.</p>
	<p>At some point, we will probably also be using other languages:</p><ul>
		<li>WebStorm for web development with javascript</li>
		<li>PyCharm, Python with Django, for web development and text processing; also to handle existing (mostly unused) Python code</li>
		<li>DataGrip for data management</li>
		<li>PHPStorm to support a site-wide web searches</li>
		<li>MSL, a DSL development system that could build a DSL for Slates to replace Rez for editing Accessor Slates</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Toolbox is a JetBrains product that provides a control panel for access to all JetBrains IDEs, regardless of language.
		Toolbox would know which of our projects use which IDE, and would also support updating of JetBrains products.</p>

<!-- @marker "Costs" -->
<h4 id='Costs_'>Costs</h4><ul>
	<li>IDEs<ul>
		<li>currently: continuing AppCode subscription: $53/yr</li>
		<li>All-Products Pack: $519 for first year, then $389/yr<ul>
			<li>does not include Team Tools</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Given our good experience with AppCode, this clearly makes sense if and when we use enough tools that it becomes cost-effective.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Team Tools for fewer than 10 users:<ul>
		<li>Hub is free</li>
		<li>UpSource is free for 10 or fewer users</li>
		<li>TeamCity<ul>
			<li>free for up to 20 build configurations and 3 build agents (probably enough)</li>
			<li>additional units of 10 build configurations and 1 build agent are $299 per year</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>YouTrack<ul>
			<li>Standalone, being installed now, version is free</li>
			<li>InCloud hosted version is $200/year, unless no private repositories or they lift that restriction<ul>
				<li>would be needed to have reliable access to Agile Boards from outside our wifi network</li>
				<li>30-day "Cloud Trial" available for InCloud version</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
