		<li id='_cdocdev_hist'>Establish Simplified History Format [_cdocdev_hist]<ul>
			<li>Each project is projected to contain an overview history file that links to smaller files for multiple threads of development. Planning for a new project can start in Support's history file.</li>
			<li>Motivation: <ul class='blurb'>
				<li>the existing system, which includes a top-level Development history file, a projected version file for each product, and a single history file for each project, all of which are interlinked, is too hard to maintain for the use we get out of it</li>
				<li>smaller per-thread files<ul>
					<li>Xcode: smaller files are better for simultaneous access to history and code because Xcode does not have a good mechanism for moving around within an HTML file (some editing of other HTML files may stay with BBEdit)</li>
					<li>Git: a per-thread file will normally be associated with its branch, so multiple branches will not all have to change the same history file</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>With the new system, it will be much easier to seamlessly start a new project, since a project's history can start in an existing file (probably Support_hist.html), move into a separate single history file, and expand with the addition of thread files. Previously, it was difficult to work on the planning process for new project without first creating a project with interlinked files.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Support_hist.html: add markers; test in BBEdit</li>
			<li>Styles<ul>
				<li>thread label: lighter blue than link; to label heading lines for threads</li>
				<li>section header: based on existing <span class='mono'>stage</span>; for sections Future (planning), Threads (existing and projected threads), Current (recording current work), Completed (stuff that has been done)</li>
				<li>startmark, endmark, shamark based on milestart, mileend, datemark</li>

<h2>Punkin Completed</h2><ul>
	<li id="Dashcode_Issues">Dashcode Issues><ul>
		<li>Xcode 4, the Xcode version that I use was, until recently, still in Developer Preview status. The Dashcode/Simulator package is also very new. There was not an installer intended to install both, and I had some apparent installation conflicts.</li>
		<li>Apparently, in early April Apple released a new installer for both Xcode 4 and the Dashcode/iOS Simulator package. Installing that package resolved a number of technical issues, but it then turned out that Dashcode's layout capability had problems serious enough to make its use impractical for the purpose planned.</li>
		<li>Dashcode can still be used to examine CSS snippets that can be used as models in creating an appropriate IOS look and feel for our application.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li class="datemark">[r6 04/22/2011</li>
	
	<li id='PlanB_7_2011'>Change In Product Design Direction: July 2011<ul>
		<li>Since we want this product to run on both iOS and Android, I had originally expected to produce the product directly in HTML. However, that strategy did not work, at least for the design phase of the project.<ul>
			<li>I have worked with basic techniques in HTML before. I was able to learn enough about the more advanced techniques I would be for this product to feel that I knew how to proceed.</li>
			<li>However, from what I learned about the design of web applications, it appears that the objective for quality software is basically to produce something that looks like it was written in iOS. There are JavaScript libraries, notably jQTouch, whose purpose is to produce the objects needed to do that in HTML, but they do not discuss User Interface design. I wound up trying to learn iOS User Interface design without using iOS directly, and have been unsuccessful.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Meanwhile, at this year's Developer Conference, Apple announced some changes that will make a MAJOR impact on my ability to efficiently write iOS software.<ul>
			<li>Interface Builder<ul>
				<li>application used with Xcode to design user interfaces for Mac and iOS software</li>
				<li>difficult enough to automate that I've never really done it successfully, so I really cannot comfortably spend much time using it</li>
				<li>Previously, it also required an inordinate amount of fine mouse work to make changes to an existing user interface, and work done in Interface Builder could not be practically translated into code for easier editing.</li>
				<li>Recent changes just announced appear to go along way toward solving both of those problems.</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Cocoa Memory Management<ul>
				<li>The new Cocoa memory management model just announced will significantly (by my observation, by more than 50%) reduce the amount of code needed to write an application, as well as reducing the learning curve for "proper" (not garbage-collected) memory management that I had not yet mastered. It also makes it possible for me to share code between my new Speech Recognition tool for Mac and iOS software, which had been impractical before.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Plan B<ul>
			<li>Produce iOS application, at least as a mockup of what we intend. We could still produce final applications for all platforms in HTML. It might also be practical (and might result in a better product) to produce an iOS version for iOS platforms. The Android product could then be translated either to HTML or to Java.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li id='xml_data_issues'>XML Data Issues: Additional Implication<ul>
			<li>We had data-definition files set up with the intent of maintaining .numbers documents with source data, an .xls document, and a .xml document produced from that by an automatic conversion process that Scott can do. However:<ul>
				<li>We now realize that we cannot add the .numbers file to the Subversion repository; see <a href="../Support/Support.html#SCPolicies_iWork">Source Control Policies: iWork</a> for details. We therefore cannot have subversion automatically check to make sure that in an up-to-date .xls document exists to match the .numbers file, since the remote Subversion server cannot find out that the .numbers file exists.</li>
				<li>Farther down the line, these data will be used to drive the actual product. The conversion process would then be difficult to manage, since the raw data would need to be converted, most conveniently involving checkin, BEFORE testing can be done.</li>
