<h1>Developer_ReadMe</h1>

<h3>Repository: Support</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This folder contains projects to set up our basic development environment.</p><ul>
	<li>script "Developer/DevConfig.ksh" DevConfig configures and sets up our basic development.</li>
	<li>Projects shunit2 (and ASUnit) are in-house scripts to install third-party products.</li>
	<li>script Developer_install.ksh runs the above scripts as indicated, and installs many other items itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>script DevConfig.ksh should be performed first, since it performs configuration and installs scripts that are needed for other development work.</p>
<p>this target automatically builds shunit2( and ASUnit, if needed later).</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>
<p>shunit2: Kate Ward and others; see Developer/shunit2_ReadMe.html</p>
<p><a href="http://nirs.freeshell.org/asunit/">ASUnit</a> is a unit testing framework for AppleScript originally written by Nir Soffer.
