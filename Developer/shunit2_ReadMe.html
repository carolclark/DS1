<h3>Description</h3>

<p>shunit2 is a Third-party script to test shell code.
This project:</p><ul>
	<li>installs the script, along with tests and supporting files, in a folder at ${HOME}/Libraries/CCDev/shunit</li>
	<li>runs shunit's included tests for each supported shell</li>
</ul><p>Note that failure of the test script does NOT generate a test failure in Xcode.
</p>

<p>Documentation and examples are also included with the source code, but are not installed.
